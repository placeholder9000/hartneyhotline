        <p class="introspiel2"> I lied in my introduction. Most (all) of these projects have little to nothing to do with
            actual web page designing efforts (sorry). Nontheless, if you are interested in what I have
            to say about 50-year-old albums and alternate-history scenarios regarding North American
            railroads with accompanied Google Earth projects, then by all means, have a gander at what follows
            below.
