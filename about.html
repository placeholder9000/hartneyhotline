            <div class="box2">About <em>me</em>? You want to know about <em>me</em>? <br> Truthfully, I'm flattered, but there isn't much to know about me. <br>
            I'm a simple man, really - I sit around with my cat while he watches me play my six-string electric twanger, and occasionally tell a bad joke whenever prompted.
            <br>Occasionally I'll cobble together a website that has the likeness of being held together by ductape - unless you are my proffesor reading this, in which case 
            I posit that this is the greatest website ever made and well deserving of a good grade. <br>
            But enough about me - to the left is a fine picture of my cat, Sevin, as a stand in for a picture of me because I don't fancy having an easily accesible picture of myself being on the internet.
            <br>Someday, I just might have enough to say to fill up the rest of this box. But as it stands, your time is best spent elsewhere checking out the other pages of this website. <br>
            Check out my <a href="projects.html">super cool and radical projects</a> if you wish to get a better "portrait of a man", so to speak.</div>
            <div class="box3"></div>
            <div class="box4">My cat Sevin (yes, that's spelled with an "i" instead of a second "e". Blame it on 8-year-old me). Believe it or not, but pesky rumors alledge that he's the real mastermind pulling the strings behind the scenes of this website.</div>
