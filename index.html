            <p class="introspiel"> I bet you're thinking to yourself right now: "god, another self-important
                schmuck who thinks he's the coolest cat on the block just because he's got
                a website. They really let <em>anyone</em> make websites nowadays!"
                <br>And to that I say - </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rude.</li>
                <li>Welp, guilty as charged.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="introspiel"> So what is this site for? The main purpose for which this site has been created 
                is for sharing projects for the Web Page Design course, of which I need not
                elaborate further upon because if you are reading this, you are either
                my professor (hello! ^w^) or a fellow classmate trying to steal my work (shame on you -_-).
                <br> Otherwise, anything else on here is purely of my own design, and will consist 
                of whatever I can put on here without jeopardizing my academic standing. 
                <br> Above are several links to navigate through the site. If you happen to be so inclined to
                read more about yours truly, then the "<a href="replaceme.html">About</a>" page
                is for you. If you are here to see the coolest and greatest Web Page Design projects known
                to mankind, then by all means direct yourself to the "<a href="replaceme.html">Projects</a>" page.
                Regardless of my exceptional web page designing abilities, I am "broke as a joke",
                as the youth of today might say. Therefore, I offer a diverse range of "<a href="replaceme.html">Services</a>"
                that I will supply in exchange for large lump sums of money (tuition ain't cheap).
                The "<a href="replaceme.html">Contact</a>" page is pretty self-explanitory, and includes
                relevent information on how to get in touch with me.</p>
